HOWTO

To use this sample code on your own domain you have to go through the following steps:

1. Create a Google Maps API key for your domain and replace my code in index.html. Set sensor=false!
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/

2. Add the IDs of the Google Latitude users you want to be displayed on the map by editing the
javascript variable APIURL. Make sure you keep ampersand chars encoded such as "%26type=json" so that
the proxy code works.

3. Copy all source files to your server and off you go tracking your friends.
